From an early age, I learned to be self-sufficient, navigating challenges with determination and resourcefulness. Growing up with limited external support, I discovered that independent learning could be my strongest asset. This drive for self-guided discovery led me to master computer programming on my own, while the complexities of biochemistry inspired me to seek formal education to fully understand life’s inner workings. My fascination with the molecular mechanisms that define living organisms ultimately led me to pursue a degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, with a minor in Mathematics, where I developed skills in genetic manipulation, bioinformatics, and data analysis.

Throughout my journey, I have been motivated by a commitment to bridge technology and biochemistry in ways that can expand our understanding of biological systems. My academic and professional experiences have reinforced my desire to tackle fundamental biological questions through innovative research, and they have shaped my ambition to contribute meaningful advancements in biochemistry. Pursuing a PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Colorado Boulder is a natural next step, as it aligns with my research goals and my personal circumstances: my wife will be attending Naropa University in Boulder, making CU Boulder the ideal institution for us to continue our academic journeys together.

I am particularly drawn to the groundbreaking work of Dr. Halil Aydin, Dr. Alexandra Whiteley, and Dr. Jeffrey Cameron. Their research in cellular morphology, protein homeostasis, and photosynthetic energy conversion aligns closely with my commitment to addressing critical biochemical challenges. I am excited to contribute to CU Boulder’s collaborative environment and work alongside faculty whose innovative approaches and dedication to interdisciplinary research inspire me.

My journey into research began as an undergraduate, where I co-founded Brain2Bot, an AI company that combined computational and biological insights. In collaboration with a neuroscientist, I applied memory and learning models from Drosophila melanogaster to develop a framework for robotic pets with biologically inspired behaviors. This project sparked my passion for interdisciplinary research, blending computational modeling with biological principles and setting the foundation for my later work in biochemistry.

During my time as an undergraduate, I continued to build my expertise by working as a student researcher on a project investigating lipid profiles in Arabidopsis thaliana. I developed a bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) outputs, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lipid analysis. My project included statistically verifying the equations used in the FAME analysis, deepening my quantitative skills and understanding of experimental design. In this role, I designed and cloned genetic constructs, performed floral dip transformations, and carried out genotyping on various tissues to track gene expression and assess experimental outcomes. Working on this project equipped me with a solid understanding of plant molecular biology techniques and analytical methods for biochemistry.

In my subsequent role as a research associate, I gained hands-on experience with more advanced techniques, including screening transgenic plant tissues through Western blotting and FAMEs analysis. I took on diverse responsibilities, managing pest control and fertilization regimes in our greenhouse while also developing remote-monitoring hardware to track plant health. Additionally, I created an in-house cloud storage solution for secure data management and project tracking, allowing our lab to streamline collaboration and data sharing.

Beyond my formal roles, I actively sought opportunities to support my peers and colleagues. I volunteered as a teaching assistant for bioinformatics classes, helping students master new tools and concepts. I also collaborated extensively with other researchers, sharing my expertise in bioinformatics and IT to support colleagues with data analysis and troubleshooting. My time in the lab underscored the importance of shared learning, and I became dedicated to fostering a collaborative environment—values I continue to uphold in my personal life, where I played bassoon in various orchestras and symphonies.

As I look toward the next phase of my academic journey, I am eager to deepen my expertise through CU Boulder’s emphasis on interdisciplinary research and innovative methodologies. My current projects, including the Develop Biology framework and the Elder programming language, reflect my desire to create tools that encourage cross-disciplinary thinking in biochemistry. At CU Boulder, I aim to contribute meaningfully to the department’s research community, collaborating with both faculty and fellow students to push the boundaries of biochemical understanding. In addition to the esteemed faculty, CU Boulder’s state-of-the-art facilities and collaborative research culture provide an ideal environment for me to explore projects that integrate bioinformatics and molecular biology, ultimately advancing our understanding of cellular function and disease mechanisms.

Long term, my goal is to pursue a career in biochemical research where I can combine laboratory work with computational methods to address fundamental biological questions. CU Boulder’s program offers the ideal environment to advance these aspirations, equipping me with the knowledge, mentorship, and resources needed to make a meaningful impact in the field of biochemistry. By building on my interdisciplinary background and research experience, I am excited to develop innovative solutions that can benefit both scientific understanding and broader societal needs.
