To be disadvantaged amidst opportunities abides a worthwhile enterprise should perseverance persuade serendipity. Thus was the impetus for my entrance to college and the vacillation that endured. 

In my second year of undergrad, I partnered with Dr. Gunnar Newquist to found a startup for what we called "natural intelligence": software that mimicked the neuronal behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, and other well studied systems. To gather more business acumen, I drafted the bylaws, joined the board, and formed a 501(c)(3) from the Reno Video Game Symphony. To make ends meet, I took a job doing website development and did extra work sweeping greenhouses and washing dishes for my lab. At the end, I found myself with 4 jobs while attending school full-time. Yet after only 3 and a half years, I graduated with a thesised B.S. degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology with a minor in Mathematics, albeit with a slightly lower gpa than I would have liked.

My thesis mentor, Dr. Amy Curran, was the COO for the biotech company ZeaKal. She trained me in nearly all parts of her company's research pipeline. I learned vector and primer design to effectively run many electrophoresis gels. I was taught cloning and transformation to move our genetic constructs into E. Coli, agrobacterium, and then into several plant species, namely Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco. While working with Dr. Curran, the greenhouse became my second home where I managed pests, harvested seeds, sampled, studied, and cared for our plants. We did a lot of leaf painting and seed plating to determine zygosity. I quite enjoyed my hands-on experience with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) gas chromatography (GC). Dr. Curran's optimized FAME extraction protocol gave me valued insights into the differences in the biotech industry vs standard academia. The GC results we gathered were qualitatively normalized to gene expression as measured by western blot. We also did some other exploratory assays with nile red staining and fluorescence spectroscopy. And while my education was efficacious, my thesis was never formalized as an academic paper.

After college, I returned to work for Dr. Curran and ZeaKal as a Research Associate. Working at UNR, I was enamored as ever with assisting the grad students with their genomics pipelines, open-cv based image quantification, and other intriguing projects. I also partnered with a friend at Amazon to develop a globally distributed cloud architecture that Dr. Curran, in Hawaiâ€˜i, and I used for data sharing and collaboration. When we needed grow space in our lab for transient assays of tobacco, I repaired some broken growth chambers and designed dedicated hardware for monitoring the growth conditions. Eventually, I became known as the resident expert on western blotting and took on a role occasionally mentoring undergrads. My patience and ability to map concepts to relatable domains has earned me compliments as an instructor both academically and professionally. While attending an undergraduate seminar on bioinformatics, I even transitioned from student to TA. The instructor, Dr. Richard Tillet, and I worked so well together that I was able to help his class despite having no knowledge of the lesson plan.

My life's goal is to extend the healthspan and well being of peoples across the globe such that our species will have the increased capacity to extend our healthspans and well being further. I believe that the only reasonable way to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to do this are through a Ph.D. program and further studies. As I have walked the line between life and computer science, I've found an untapped wealth of innovation in the tech startup world that has not made its way to research - academic or private. With a Ph.D. and the right connections, I believe I could assist in building a lab that embraces agile methodologies and automation in a way that allows future researchers to enmesh themselves in a collaborative environment with machines.

After the pandemic, I made the tough decision to leave ZeaKal and set out on my own. Since then, I've advised startups and worked as a senior software engineer, mentoring other engineers and building collaborative solutions across products and departments. Today, I run a slowly growing website development and hosting business which supports my long-term efforts of building an open-source, generalized software framework for biomimicry wrapped in a simple, accessible language.

The more I learn about CU Boulder, the more I see reflections of my own values for technological advancement through a people-first, community-centered mindset. The IQ Biology program seems apropos of someone with a diverse background to immerse themselves in the university and find the place they can do the most good. While looking into the professors at CU Boulder, I believe Dr. Halil Aydin, Dr. Jeffrey Cameron, and Dr. Alexandra Whiteley would all be fantastic advisors for me.

Dr. Aydin's work on neuronal morphology would dovetail well with the work I did with Dr. Newquist and endow me with the expertise to address neurodegenerative diseases.

Dr. Cameron's work seems the natural extension of my work with Dr. Curran. I would absolutely love to improve photosynthesis and ensure we continue to have food and fuel as our climate changes. I've already worked closely with other startups focused on automated hydroponics for feeding inner city kids and space colonies alike. There's a lot of potential for future collaboration with Dr. Cameron.

Working with Dr. Whiteley seems like it would give me a broad understanding of many different cellular systems and would greatly benefit my future research into myriad senescence mechanisms.

I am increasingly excited about the opportunities CU Boulder presents. I'm very much looking forward to building lasting relationships with the campus faculty, and effecting multidisciplinary advancements with the Boulder community.
