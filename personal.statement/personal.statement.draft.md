To be disadvantaged amidst opportunities abides a worthwhile enterprise should perseverance persuade serendipity. Thus was the impetus for my entrance to college and the vacillation that endured. 

My life's goal is to extend the healthspan and well being of peoples across the globe such that our species will have the increased capacity to further extend our healthspans and well being. A Ph.D. in biochemistry seems to be the most reasonable way to garner the knowledge and skills to do this. As I have walked the line between computer and life sciences, I have found an untapped wealth of innovation in the tech startup world that has not made its way to research - academic or private. With a Ph.D. and the right support, I would endeavor to assist in building a lab that embraces agile methodologies and automation in a way that allows future researchers to enmesh themselves in a collaborative workplace with machines.

I can say with certainty that my values of technological advancement through a people-first, community-centered mindset are strongly reflected in the academic community on the CU Boulder campus. The IQ Biology program seems apropos of someone with a diverse background to immerse themselves in the university and find the place they can do the most good. Regarding potential mentors, I believe Dr. Halil Aydin, Dr. Karolin Luger, and Dr. Alexandra Whiteley would all be fantastic advisors for me.

I partnered with Dr. Gunnar Newquist in the second year of my bachelor's degree at the University of Nevada, Reno to found a startup for software that mimicked the neuronal behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, and other well studied systems. For further business acumen, I drafted the bylaws, joined the board, and formed a 501(c)(3) from the Reno Video Game Symphony. To make ends meet, I took a job doing website development and did extra work sweeping greenhouses and washing dishes for my lab. At the end, I found myself with 4 jobs while attending school full-time. After only 3 and a half years, I graduated with a thesised B.S. degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and a minor in Mathematics.

Dr. Aydin's work on neuronal morphology would dovetail with the work I did with Dr. Newquist. I already have a strong background in designing synthetic neurons in silico which should synergize quite well with modeling the functional needs of differing morphologies. Ultimately, I'd look to studying under Dr. Aydin to enrich my expertise in addressing neurodegenerative diseases.

My thesis mentor, Dr. Amy Curran, was the COO for the biotech company ZeaKal. She trained me in nearly all parts of her company's research pipeline. I learned vector and primer design to effectively run electrophoresis gels. I was taught cloning and transformation to move our genetic constructs into E. Coli, agrobacterium, and then into several plant species, namely Arabidopsis thaliana and tobacco. While working with Dr. Curran, the greenhouse became my second home where I managed pests, harvested seeds, sampled, studied, and cared for our plants. We did a lot of leaf painting and seed plating to determine zygosity. I quite enjoyed my hands-on experience with fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) gas chromatography. Dr. Curran's optimized FAME extraction protocol gave me valued insights into the differences in the biotech industry vs standard academia. We qualitatively normalized our results to gene expression as measured by western blot. We also did some other exploratory assays with nile red staining and fluorescence spectroscopy.

Dr. Luger's cancer-focused research would be the perfect extension of my studies with Dr. Curran. Delving into the organizational and regulatory mechanisms of chromatin would complete my hands on experience of life as a progression from DNA to phenotype. Beside that, the crystallographic techniques used in Dr. Luger's lab are ones that I have always wanted to learn.

After college, I returned to work for Dr. Curran and ZeaKal as a Research Associate. Being at UNR, I was enamored with assisting the graduate students with their genomics pipelines, open-cv based image quantification, and other intriguing projects. Through my employment, I became respected as an expert on western blotting and accepted a role mentoring undergraduates. I was sought as an instructor, both academically and professionally, for my patience and ability to map ideas to relatable concepts. For example, while attending one undergraduate seminar on bioinformatics, the instructor, Dr. Richard Tillet, made me an impromptu TA. He and I worked so well together that I was able to help his class despite having no knowledge of the lesson plan.

Beyond assisting students, I was also able to leverage my technical expertise to assist ZeaKal as well. I collaborated with a colleague at Amazon to develop a globally distributed cloud architecture that eased our data sharing and collaboration. I also repaired some broken growth chambers and designed dedicated hardware for monitoring the growth conditions of our tobacco.

Dr. Whiteley's work seems to explore many diverse systems and would likely allow me the most flexibility in terms of multidisciplinary research. Working under her would give me a broad understanding of many different cellular systems and would greatly benefit my future research into myriad senescence mechanisms.

After the pandemic, I decided to leave ZeaKal to build a business of my own. Since then, I have advised startups and worked as a senior software engineer. I was responsible for managing and maintaining production web services, implementing data analytics systems, mentoring other engineers, and building collaborative solutions across departments. Today, I lead a cloud technologies startup which supports my long-term efforts of building an open-source framework for biomimicry and an accessible programming language.

CU Boulder offers unparalleled opportunities to advance my career and enable me to help our communities assume longevity. I am eager to forge lasting relationships with the campus faculty and community while effecting multidisciplinary advancements. I am confident that I will thrive when my commitment to innovative, compassionate research is engulfed by the collaborative spirit of the University of Colorado Boulder.
