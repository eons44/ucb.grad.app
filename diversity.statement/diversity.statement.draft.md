Growing up with limited external support and learning to navigate challenges on my own, I gained a deep appreciation for the importance of community, mentorship, and accessible learning. My early experiences taught me resilience and resourcefulness, and as I progressed in my studies and career, I became dedicated to sharing knowledge and supporting others who might face similar challenges. I believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are vital in science and academia, not only for the strength they bring to research but also for the opportunities they create for every individual to thrive and contribute fully.

My commitment to community and service began early. In high school, as an Eagle Scout and member of the National Honor Society, I took part in numerous community service initiatives, each reinforcing the value of giving back and supporting others. Later, I co-founded the Reno Video Game Symphony, where I helped lead the organization through the process of becoming a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. These experiences taught me the importance of collaborative environments where each member can contribute meaningfully, a lesson that has continued to shape my approach in both academic and professional settings.

My professional journey has also been driven by a desire to address critical issues in food security and human rights. At ZeaKal, I contributed to projects aimed at engineering more nutritious and resilient crops, supporting a vision of sustainable agriculture in response to climate change. Similarly, at AOE Greens, I worked on automated farm systems designed to bring fresh produce to local communities, a project that reinforced my belief in technology as a means of providing accessible nutrition to underserved areas. Beyond my work in agriculture, I have supported my biological father’s human rights activism through the Indigenous Environmental Network by providing web and cloud tools that facilitate global collaboration and information-sharing among Indigenous communities. These experiences have shown me the profound impact that scientific and technological solutions can have on improving lives and fostering resilience in diverse communities.

As an undergraduate, I actively sought to foster inclusive learning environments. I volunteered as a teaching assistant for bioinformatics classes, initially stepping in to support peers who were new to complex tools and concepts. Helping other students troubleshoot analytical methods and master new skills underscored the importance of accessible education and ignited my passion for mentorship. In my research roles, I worked closely with colleagues across different labs, offering assistance with data analysis, troubleshooting, and even IT support to ensure that everyone had the resources they needed to pursue their projects. By sharing my expertise in bioinformatics and computational tools, I hope to have contributed to a collaborative and supportive atmosphere.

My dedication to accessibility and open learning also extends beyond the classroom and lab. As a software developer, I am committed to creating resources that empower others to explore and innovate, regardless of their background or resources. This commitment is exemplified in my open-source projects, including the Develop Biology framework and the Elder programming language, which are designed to encourage cross-disciplinary thinking and make scientific concepts more accessible. By developing these tools, I aim to bridge gaps in knowledge and make scientific discovery more attainable for others.

As I join the University of Colorado Boulder, I am excited to contribute to the Department of Biochemistry’s inclusive and collaborative environment. I look forward to supporting my peers, both by sharing technical skills and fostering a community where diverse perspectives are valued and encouraged. I believe that the strength of an academic community lies in its diversity and that by building accessible learning resources, supporting colleagues, and contributing to open science, I can help cultivate a welcoming, innovative, and productive research environment at CU Boulder.
