The hallmark of prion disease is a feedback loop between graphical vertices. Thus a healthy system is necessarily born of a large and varied sampling of the environment within which the system is enmeshed. I believe this holds true for animals, people, communities, and most graphically abstracted complex systems. Similarly, our isolated intentions of growth are malevolent, but when we keep our focus on our community, our intentions of growth become benevolent. For example, the difference between greed as "money for money's sake" and the paradox of intollerance is that the latter is qualified with an intent to benefit society. Stating an intent to "invest money in making money for everyone" is not often seen as greedy.

It has ever been my goal to build strong connections, communities, and systems. I grew up without a father and with a mentally ill, single mother. As a child, my home was a small trailer with a leaky roof and cramped with papers and "important" items. I took the bus home from elementary school, cooked myself top ramen, and spent my evenings walking along the beach, watching the sunset. Despite being poor, I was still given ample opportunities to succeed. In high school, I became an Eagle Scout, did plenty of community service through high school with groups like the National Honors Society, got my amateur radio license and lightly participated in the Amateur Radio Emergency Services, took private lessons in bassoon, played in the Reno Philharmonic Youth Concert Orchestra and the Reno Video Game Symphony, took 11 AP classes with the rest being mostly honors, taught myself C++, and, in my senior year, took college biology.

I would not have been able to accomplish so much if not for the good will and assistance my community lent me. My success is the work of a village and, in turn, I yearn to give back to my community and see our species grow to achieve all that we can. Counter to this, I've had friends through the years, grad students included, who have not recieved the support they've needed and have committed suicide. As friends, colleagues, and leaders, mental health is not something we can afford to ignore. Let's make sure we're checking in with those around us and making them feel seen and appreciated in every chance get!

In my professional role as a senior software engineer, I was privileged to work on a team that was about 50 / 50 men and women, which is rare in the software field. I believe the success our team experienced was largely due to our gender diversity. I've experienced the same diversity driven success in music and the lab.

Today, I work with science communication organizations across the nation, including the colorful Pacific Islands, and do my best to build websites that are accessible and useful to all the audiences that can take advantage of the latest research in fire science and land management. When I can, I also assist the Indiginous Environmental Network with ensuring tribes and native peoples around the globe have access to news on climate change and as much representation in global politics as we can manage.

It would be my pleasure to uplift the community and encourage the spirit of inclusion and collaborative success at CU Boulder.
