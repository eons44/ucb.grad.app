Growing up without much support and a mother facing significant mental health challenges, I learned to navigate the world with resilience and resourcefulness. These early experiences taught me the value of independence and the strength that comes from working with others facing their own challenges. My path has shaped a deep empathy and respect for people from all backgrounds, particularly those with limited access to resources and opportunities. These principles guide my work today, and they have motivated my contributions to inclusive and collaborative environments in both my career and community.

Throughout my academic and professional life, I have been fortunate to work with diverse teams that share a commitment to accessible and equitable technology. At Zywave, my team was composed of nearly equal numbers of men and women, which was rare in software engineering. Our balanced team experienced fewer outages and setbacks than many others in the companyâ€”a powerful testament to the benefits of diversity. This experience showed me firsthand how different perspectives strengthen technical outcomes and how inclusivity can create an environment where everyone feels empowered to contribute.

My passion for community support is evident in my volunteer work and professional endeavors. As a high school Eagle Scout and National Honor Society member, I led community service projects, and later, I co-founded the Reno Video Game Symphony as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. These experiences developed my leadership skills and underscored the importance of creating spaces where people from all walks of life can come together, whether through music or service.

Beyond my direct work, I support my father in his activism with the Indigenous Environmental Network, providing web and cloud tools to facilitate collaboration and information dissemination. Additionally, my work with ZeaKal and AOE Greens allowed me to focus on increasing food security and nutritional value for underserved populations. These projects deepened my commitment to using biochemistry and technology to address global challenges, especially for communities facing food insecurity and environmental threats.

My commitment to mental health is also a core aspect of my work. The loss of a graduate colleague to suicide and other close friends to similar struggles left a lasting impact. I believe that the people we work with matter more than the work itself, and I am committed to creating supportive, open environments for my colleagues. I hope to bring this perspective with me as I work to contribute to CU Boulder's inclusive community.

As I move forward in my academic journey, I am excited to continue fostering diverse and supportive spaces in biochemistry. I look forward to collaborating with peers and faculty who value inclusivity and to helping create an environment where everyone can thrive, regardless of their background.
