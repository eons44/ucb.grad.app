_The hallmark of prion disease is a short feedback loop between an organism and itself. Thus a healthy system is necessarily born of a large and varied sampling of the environment within which the system is enmeshed. I believe this holds true for animals, people, communities, and most abstracted, complex systems._

The products of a team are made more adaptable for that team's diversity. Regardless of whether it's a small ensemble playing music, a business meeting the needs of its customers, or university lab doing cutting edge research, a variegated perspective benefits all. Across the CU Boulder campus, I will do my absolute best to engender an environment of communal ownership, supportive enablement, and growth.

It is my goal to build strong connections, communities, and systems. I grew up without a father and with a mentally ill, single mother. As a child, my home was a small trailer with a leaky roof and cramped with papers and "important" items. I took the bus home from elementary school, cooked myself top ramen, and spent my evenings walking along the beach, watching the sunset. Despite being poor, I was still given ample opportunities to succeed. While I attended high school in Nevada, I became an Eagle Scout, did plenty of community service, participated in the Amateur Radio Emergency Services, played bassoon in the Reno Philharmonic Youth Orchestra and the Reno Video Game Symphony, took 11 AP classes, taught myself C++, and, in my senior year, took college biology.

I would not have been able to accomplish so much if not for the generosity and assistance my community lent me. In turn, I yearn to give back and help others achieve their dreams even if they began their lives with few advantages. I've had friends through the years, grad students included, who have not received the support they've needed. Some of those have, unfortunately, committed suicide. As friends, colleagues, and leaders, mental health is not something we can afford to ignore. Given this, I always make sure to check in with those around me and help them feel seen and appreciated.

_Isolated intentions of growth can become malignant, but when we focus on our community, our intentions of growth become positive and uplifting. For example, the difference between greed as "money for money's sake" and the paradox of intolerance is that the latter is qualified with an intent to benefit society. It is an altruistic endeavor to invest money in making money for everyone._

In my professional role as a senior software engineer for Zywave, I was privileged to work on a team of diverse individuals which is rare in the software field. I believe the success our team experienced was largely due to our heterogeneity. For example, our platform handled billions of dollars in insurance quotes a month and experienced virtually 0% downtime. While at Zywave, I made more money than I needed at the time. Instead of simply saving those funds, I believed the best investment I could make was in the skills of those around me. Thus, I paid a few individuals what I could to learn about new technologies and aid me in developing open-source software tools that would save us time in the years to come. Today, my clients and their customers rely on the tools my employees developed as a direct result of wealth sharing.

Being inclusive of those with disabilities can improve team performance as much as gender and cultural diversity. I now work with science communication organizations across the nation, including the Great Basin Native Plant Project, Great Plains Fire Science Exchange, and Pacific Climate Exchange. With these organizations, I build websites that are accessible and useful to as many audiences as we can muster. As these groups came to embrace technological accessibility, the quality of their digital assets improved dramatically. For example, some clients have engaged my company to remake their PDFs as web pages that can be read with screen readers; the new pages were so much better that we were asked to convert them back into PDFs for print.

I firmly believe in providing equitable opportunities and will do what I can to enable underrepresented peoples on campus. After reconnecting with my biological father, I began using my cloud platform to assist his endeavors with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Together, we ensure native peoples have access to news on climate change and increasing representation in global politics.

It would be my pleasure to uplift the community and encourage the spirit of inclusion and collaborative success at the University of Colorado Boulder.
