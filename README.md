Dr. Halil Aydin is an Assistant Professor whose research focuses on molecular neurobiology and biophysics. His lab investigates how human cells adapt their morphology and spatial distribution to changing conditions, with a particular interest in proteins and protein complexes associated with membranes. Their work aims to understand the mechanistic details of cellular functions using structural approaches, cell biology tools, biophysics, and high-resolution imaging techniques.

Dr. Jeffrey Cameron: An associate professor whose research focuses on photosynthetic energy conversion and the development of bio-inspired energy systems. His work at the intersection of biochemistry and renewable energy technologies may align with your experience in plant molecular biology and bioinformatics.

Dr. Alexandra Whiteley is an Assistant Professor whose research centers on protein homeostasis, particularly the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Her lab employs mass-spectrometry-based proteomics alongside in vivo and cell biological methods to explore how ubiquitin receptors, such as Ubiquilins, facilitate protein degradation. This research has significant implications for understanding diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Dr. Karolin Luger: A distinguished professor and Jennie Smoly Caruthers Endowed Chair of Biochemistry, Dr. Luger's research involves the structural biology of chromatin and nucleosome assembly. Her expertise in protein-DNA interactions and structural biochemistry could provide a strong foundation for your interests in molecular biology.
